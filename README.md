This Repo helps you to build a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.

Anyone who wants to build CI/CD pipeline to Deploy Applications or Microservices on EKS Kubernetes can use it.  
Tools/Technologies used during this project are: AWS EC2, Terraform, Github, Jenkins, Maven, Docker, Helm and Kubernetes (EKS).  

Note: You should have AWS account. I used AWS free tier and default vpc for simplicity. You may change accordingly.  

I have divided the workshop into below sections. Refer to the individual sections' readme files for more info. Happy Learning!!!
